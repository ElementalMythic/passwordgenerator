# passwordgenerator

## About my work:

### Discription

For this challenge, bootcamp students had to make a password generator using JavaScript.
Students were given starter code but had to come up with most of the JavaScript.
This was my first time working with JavaScript and it sure was a challenge! 
I had to take notes and make sure that I was using comments to keep my thoughts and code organized.
I learned a lot of new tricks and how JavaScript reads code. 
Working through the many challenges I had I learned about ASCII which really helped me.
Being able to simplify my code it much more readable.

### Design

The following image shows how it should appear in the users browser:
